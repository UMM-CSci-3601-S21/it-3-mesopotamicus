This is your starter code for Iteration 1.

There are a number of pieces in this production template to help you get started. As you work on your project, you should replace some of these pieces with elements of your project and remove whatever you don't need (e.g., markdown files, JSON data files, or any remnants of the labs). We include, for example, the users parts of the
previous labs. These are almost certainly not relevant to your project
and should be removed once you've started.

:exclamation: You should remove this sentence and the text above, and
replace them with least an elevator pitch description of your project so that
if someone comes to this repo they'll know what the project is about.

## [Development](DEVELOPMENT.md)

Instructions on setting up the development environment and working with the code are in [the development guide](DEVELOPMENT.md).

### Common commands

From the `server` directory:
- `./gradlew run` to start the server
- `./gradlew test` to test the server

From the `client` directory:
- `ng serve` to run the client
- `ng test` to test the client
- `ng e2e` and `ng e2e --watch` to run end-to-end tests

From the `database` directory:
- `./mongoseed.sh` (or `.\mongoseed.bat` on Windows) to seed the database

## [Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md)

Instructions on how to create a DigitalOcean Droplet and setup your project are in [the deployment guide](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## [Resources](RESOURCES.md)

Additional resources on tooling and techniques are in [the resources list](RESOURCES.md).

## Changing the name

The project by default has the name "CSCI 3601 Iteration Template". There are a few places you need to change to make this the name you want:

- The title of this README.md
- [`server/src/main/java/umm3601/Server.java`](server/src/main/java/umm3601/Server.java)
  - The `appName` variable
- [`client/src/app/app.component.ts`](client/src/app/app.component.ts)
  - The `title` variable
  - Also the associated unit and E2E tests will need to be changed.
- [`client/src/app/app.component.html`](client/src/app/app.component.html)
  - The `mat-toolbar` element for the navigation drawer is just "Client" by default.
- [`client/src/index.html`](client/src/index.html)
  - The `title` element

You can go ahead and remove this section of the README once you have changed the name.
